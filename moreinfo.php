<h2>Rome</h2>
<h3>Night Life</h3>

<p>The typical Roman evening starts with an aperitif around 7 pm. That’s when you can enjoy a cocktail or a glass of wine with delicious snacks or even a whole buffet. 
Then comes the dinner, which Italians prefer having late in the evening. It often lasts until 10 pm. Almost all the nightclubs and cocktail bars in Rome we’re about to mention have great dinner menus you can enjoy before heading to the dance floor.
Parties usually don’t begin until 11-12 pm. The steamy dancefloors and lively summer terraces quickly get crowded and dancing continues until dawn.

<h4>The Magick Bar</h4>
<p>An atmospheric cocktail bar in Rome’s Prati neighborhood. The Magick Bar is a real hidden gem and a perfect summer escape in the middle of the city. 
Why? Enjoy an early evening ambient DJ set on a living room style terrace above Tiber River. This isn’t your typical touristy aperitivo bar; expect a mostly local and hip crowd here!
Opening times: every day from June to September 6 pm - 2 am
Address: Lungotevere Guglielmo Oberdan, 2, 00195 Roma RM, Italy

<h4>Alcazar Live</h4>

            <p>I had the best breakfast in a little cafe called Barnum Cafe. Not very expensive and the staff was so nice. Went there all the time to grab a bite before class!</p>
