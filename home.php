<h2> Rome </h2>

<section>
<p>Welcome to Rome! For good reason, Italy is one of the most popular destinations for American study abroad students, and within Italy, Rome is one of the cities they often look towards for study abroad programs.
With a modern and cosmopolitan lifestyle, ancient Roman landmarks, and all the aspects of quintessential Italian life -- the food, the style, the pace of life -- it'll be hard not to fall in love with Rome.
Not to mention, though you'll need a good level of Italian to study directly at one of Rome's universities, there are dozens of alternative options for students who either want to conduct courses in English or improve their Italian.
